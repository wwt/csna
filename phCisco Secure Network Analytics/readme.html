  Cisco Secure Network Analytics (Stealthwatch) uses NetFlow meta data to feed into its analytics. It also imports contextual data from Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and also ingests proxy, web, and endpoint data to provide comprehensive visibility. If you do need to investigate the payload, Stealthwatch integrates with major packet capture solutions so you can selectively analyze the malicious traffic pinpointed by Stealthwatch.
